# World-Of-Gensokyo-Touhou-Mod
*A Base Ruleset Touhou mod that takes place in a world - set in Japanese mythology - called Gensokyo. This mod is still in it's early and experimental form, however, I wish you can enjoy it! (Visit the GitHub page for more info)*

Apparently, this mod was made entirely with a phone, and since that it is, it will take longer to update changes than normal. There are still a lot of ~~anime moes~~ totally necessary things to add and change, because the mod isn't really properly playtested yet.

**The mod currently only supports FantasyHex tileset** which is pretty painful, considering the fact that I drew the modded terrains myself and it looked *a little* terrible, I need to take up more time to fix that.
However, this mod already took like 5 months to reach this point and I'm only getting less and less free time, that's why I uploaded it now.

That's it for the lore. You can visit my thread for the discussion of this mod in the official Unciv discord server.
Have a great day
